# Smart Greenhouse Project

**Smart Greenhouse** is an intelligent system designed to automate and optimize the growth and health of plants by maintaining ideal temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels for plant inside greenhouse. The system uses sensor data to monitor the greenhouse environment and employs AI algorithms to adjust conditions as needed, ensuring consistent and tailored care for the plants.

### Essential Capabilities
1. AI Planning for automatic watering, ventilation, and lighting based on sensor data.
2. Integration with weather forecasts to adjust strategies.
3. Visualization of collected data and manual control over greenhouse.
4. Tailored care based on plant types.
